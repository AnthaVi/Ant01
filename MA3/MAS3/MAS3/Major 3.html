  The Beginning
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="Text">
        My Journey into UCF is quite the Journey, but to really explain how deep that runs, I need to first explain where it all began: Valencia College.
        <br>
        <br>
        Around my senior year in highschool, I had already begun to take college classes at Valenica. It was quite interesting because my highschool schedule was very short; I would go to the highschool itself for half a day and then the other half was spent in Valencia itself. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I would have likely started the college classes in my junior year, however there was a problem with my transcripts being transferred over from my previous highschool and thus i had to lose a semester of dual enrollment

    Degree
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="Text">
    After one more semester of college at Valencia after Highschool, I finally got my Associates of Arts Degree. This was essentially my one way ticket to get into UCF and is a key reason why i'm even doing the project you currently see in front of you. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It honestly feels nice to have a degree of any sort in my posession as a way to remind myself of all that I have accomplished thus far.

    Current Day

<br>
<div class="Text">
    After getting my Degree, I finally started going to UCF! 
    <br>
    <br>
    I started in 2020 and it is now 2023 which means I should be Graduating soon! it's been a long journey for me thats had many ups and downs, but i've learned a lot about coding in my time here and feel like i've honed my skills a lot more. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I may have taken some breaks and had some slip ups in my college career up until now but i've managed to push through to where I am right now and be at the level I am right now as a result so I'm content with it. I hope everyone else has good luck in their college careers moving forward!
