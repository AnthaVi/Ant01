<!-- Beggining will start with the beginning and roots of Acid Jazz, will have less color to represent this being the past -->

<p>
    The roots of Acid Jazz can be traced all the way back to club music in London from the 1980s, 
    specifically from a French-English DJ named "Gilles Peterson", who began to use the phrase "Acid Jazz" as an antithesis 
    to Acid House music that was popular in European Nightclubs.

    Evolution of Acid Jazz
</h2>

<p tag="Evolution">
While Acid jazz did start in London, It eventually began to spread throughout the world, starting with the USA. It first emerged in America in 1990, when 
British promoter Maurice Bernstein and his partner Jonathan Rudnick opened "Groove Academy" as a party at the Giant Step club in Union Square. 
This eventually lead to Acid Jazz becoming very widespread throughout the whole country as more and more musicians took up the genre.

Since its creation, Acid Jazz has continued to be a popular form of music, and is widely used in all forms of media
 One form of such modern media that uses Acid Jazz is video games. An example of one is the soundtrack of the 2016 game: 
 "Persona 5". The game's soundtrack is often praised as being one of the best soundtracks of all time in a video game, and that is thanks to its use of Acid Jazz.
