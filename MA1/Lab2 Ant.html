    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>
   Acid Jazz is a form of Jazz that incorporates elements from not only Jazz, but funk, soul, and hip hop as well.
</p>

<!-- Beginning will start with the beginning and roots of Acid Jazz, will have less color to represent this being the past -->

<p>
    The roots of Acid Jazz can be traced all the way back to club music in London from the 1980s, 
    specifically from a French-English DJ named "Gilles Peterson", who began to use the phrase "Acid Jazz" as an antithesis to Acid House music that was popular in European Nightclubs.

 One form of such modern media that uses Acid Jazz is video games. An example of one is the soundtrack of the 2016 game: "Persona 5". The game's soundtrack is often praised as being one of the best soundtracks of all time in a video game, and that is thanks to its use of Acid jazz
